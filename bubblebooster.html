    <h1>Bubble Boosters</h1>

    <body>

        <p>Our group googled numerous boba type cups and then went on a search to find the perfect prototype. In our discussion, we decided on using a large rectangular shape that was made out of recyclable plastic. To make it durable, long-lasting and light for the user and demographic. Simultaneously, we ideated our mood board to fit the teen demographic linking it to social media as people like to document these moments with their friends and having a good time which is also we captured in our commercial.

            Our group also then took the next step to thoroughly research ingredients to make it healthy targeting each specific purpose observed below. Transforming them into herbal remedies! We then filmed our commercial in Washington Square Park as it was a fitting location with the weather, and happy energy.
            
            Working in a group, I discovered my strengths and weaknesses and how to maximize them. As a result, I was given the task of visually representing the presentation. This included incorporating the color scheme into the presentation and selecting a typeface for the brand. I wanted it to be playful, refreshing and fun! Thatâ€™s when I realized my strength was communicating our ideas through fonts, bubbles, and stickers with our slogans. I also helped in researching the statistics for our demographic and for the prototype of the product. 
            
            Making the advertisement strengthened our team as a whole, and we got to bask in the sun with our product! I loved this assignment and it was an overall thrilling experience to create a brand we can call our own! </p>
